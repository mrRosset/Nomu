/*
From Symbian ^3 documentation on TRomImageHeader

ROM file images have the following sections:

The header
.text  - code
.rdata - constant (read-only) data
.edata - the export directory
.data  - initialised data that is copied to RAM when the executable runs.
The DLL reference table (a TDllRefTable structure), which is a list of DLLs
used by the executable.
